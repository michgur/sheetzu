sheets tui üê∂

## ideas (random order)
### UI
- visual selection
- insert mode - select cells via \<M-hjkl>
- command mode
- csv read/write
- infinite sheet (how does this work? chunks?)
- custom file type with styling etc.
### Design
- how should motions work? specifically long-text cells
    - this is not a text editor, maybe leave that part bare-bones
### Logic
- functions
- ranges
- "drag" logic
- copy ASTs instead of values
