sheets tui üê∂

## ideas (random order)
### UI
- visual selection
- command mode
- csv read/write
- virtual cursor in insert mode
- infinite sheet (how does this work? chunks?)
- custom file type with styling etc.
### Logic
- formula engine, with cell dependency trees
    - maybe formulas are themselves trees (basically ASTs), where literals are leaves etc.
### Design
- how should motions work? specifically long-text cells
    - this is not a text editor, maybe leave that part bare-bones
